# Data Science in C? (version 2.0)

Data Science in C, the title seems like a joke, but I assure you it is not. This title is a very synthetical way to describe the book. *Modeling with data, Tools and Techniques for Scientific Computing*<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>  writen by *Ben Klemens*.

This is the kind of book I like, a combination of code, mathematics and prose. A book that talks about the issues, but also shows you how to do it, a true book that follows the philosophy of the pragmatic programmer.

It is also, from my perspective a valuable learning tool, my background as a *survey engineer* is unfortunately far from the topics described in the book, and it has taken me a lot of personal self-work to learn these topics, and without the valuable help of books like this one, and in particular books with styles like this one, it would have been impossible.

Finally a disclaimer, this blog post, is inspired by a personal blog post of my teacher and mentor Jordi Inglada  <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
